[00:13.62] I'll marry my lover in a place to admire
[00:19.53] I don't have to even ask her, I can look in her eyes
[00:23.98] And thank God that I am forgiven
[00:30.15] Or thank all of my friends to say I've been true or they've forgotten
[01:04.65] 
[00:48.44] And weary my mind is, to say the least
[00:54.80] It's been awful hard to just stand on my feet
[01:01.19] I think I'll slow down if I am able
[01:06.53] I won't drown in the ocean or starve at my place at the table
[01:37.03] 
[01:25.58] Lucky ones are we all 'till it is over
[01:30.75] Everyone near and far
[01:37.12] When you smile the sun, it peeks through the clouds
[01:43.01] Never die, for always be around and around and around
[02:09.51] 
[02:02.02] And how is your sister and what of your brother?
[02:08.40] Extend hellos to your father and mother
[02:13.77] What in the world would cause you any sorrow?
[02:19.16] Lighten your load and see how I killed the wheelbarrow I borrowed
[02:51.66] 
[02:37.64] Lucky ones are we all 'till it is over
[02:43.22] Everyone near and far
[02:49.25] When you smile the sun, it peeks through the clouds
[02:55.40] Never die, for always be around and around and around

I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
And keep him company
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
And live by the side of the sea
I'll polish his lamps by the light of day
So the ships at night can find their way
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper
Won't that be okay?
We'll have parties on a coral reef
And clam-bakes on the shore
We'll invite the neighbours in
And seagulls by the score
I dream of living in a lighthouse, baby
Every single day
I dream of living in a lighthouse
The white one by the bay
So if you want to make my dreams come true
You'll be a lighthouse keeper too
We could live in a lighthouse
The white one by the bay.
I'll polish his lamps by the light of day
So the ships at night can find their way
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper
Won't that be okay?
We'll take walks along the moonlit bay
Maybe find a treasure, too
I'd love living in a lighthouse
How 'bout you?
I dream of living in a lighthouse, baby,
Every single day
I dream of living in a lighthouse
The white one by the bay
So if you want to make my dreams come true
You'll be a lighthouse keeper, too
We could live in a lighthouse
The white one by the bay
Won't that be okay?
